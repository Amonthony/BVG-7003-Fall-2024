# oLLMpics: Team-Based Bioinformatics Challenge

Welcome to the **oLLMpics**, where your bioinformatics skills will be tested in a series of challenges designed to reinforce your previous knowledge while introducing you to the power of AI tools like **Microsoft Copilot or ChatGPT**.

In this challenge, you will be divided into two teams—**Team 1** and **Team 2**—each with a set of tasks. Some tasks will allow the use of AI, such as Microsoft Copilot or ChatGPT, to assist in solving coding and analysis problems, while other tasks will require you to rely on your notes, Google, or support from your professor.

The objective is to complete each task according to the rules set for your team, honing your ability to decide when AI tools are most effective and when traditional methods of research and problem-solving are necessary.

The **first team to successfully complete all their tasks** wins the oLLMpics.

For each task, pay careful attention to whether the use of AI is permitted and ensure that your team completes all steps in the correct order.

Good luck, and may the best team win!
